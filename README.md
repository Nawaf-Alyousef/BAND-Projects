## Summary about the projects

## Project1.[Analyse NYSE Data](https://github.com/Nawaf-Alyousef/DAND-Project/tree/main/Project1_Exploring%20Weathr%20Trends)
* In this project, we use NYSE dataset that contains financial data for Fortune 500 companies We analyse this dataset and design a dashboard that calculates the financial metrics and auto populates the income statement for each company using data validation and advanced lookup tools within Excel. We forecast these metrics within the income statement, based on three scenarios with distinct assumptions.
* Tool: Excel

## Project2.[Build Data Dashboards](https://github.com/Nawaf-Alyousef/DAND-Project/tree/main/Project2_Investigate%20Dataset)
*In this project, we build interactive dashboards with Tableau to tell stories from data. We use a dataset of Youtube it includes a bunch of information for videos that were trending for at least one day in the US to visualize the categories are the most liked and disliked, find the tags have grow in popularity over time, and more. Upon completion of this project, we are able to evaluate effectiveness of a data visualisation and build engaging Tableau dashboards.
*Tools:Excel,Tableau

## Project3.[Analyze A/B Test Results](https://github.com/Nawaf-Alyousef/DAND-Project/tree/main/Project3_Analyze%20AB%20Test%20Results)
* A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists
* I was working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My  goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page or keep the old page or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
* Tool: Jupyter Notebook (Python)
* Programming library: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels.api, random, scipy.stats

## Project4.[Wrangling Analyze tweet archive dataset](https://github.com/Nawaf-Alyousef/DAND-Project/tree/main/Project4_Wrangling%20Analyze%20data)
* The dataset that I was wrangling and analyzing and visualizing  the tweet archive , This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017, tweet archive  of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage
* My goal was to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations
* Tool: Jupyter Notebook (Python)
* Programming library: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, requests, tweepy, json 

## Project5.[Exploration Flights Dataset](https://github.com/Nawaf-Alyousef/DAND-Project/tree/main/Project5_Exploration%20Flights%20Dataset)
* This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I was using Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I was producing a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset.
* These dataset for 2000 year that are information about all aspects of the flight for the US, such as departure time, arrival time, departure airport, and arrival airport,and this dataset Contains 5683047 entries and 22 columns. I get Those dataset from http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html
* Tool: Jupyter Notebook (Python)
* Programming library: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.express
